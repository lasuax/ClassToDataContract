# ClassToDataContract
Converts your class files into DataContract and DataMember architecture for WCF Services 


I needed to turn my object classes into DataContracts and DataMembers for a project. So, I searched for a tool to do this however 
there were nothing useful.Eventually I've found myself creating this one :)

Have fun.
